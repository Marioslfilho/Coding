# Coding
I created this GitHub repository with a few codes I wrote. They are simple and minimal, but they serve the purpose I needed.

I worked for a year as a research assistant at CLEAR-EESP, where I learned to break down a project into multiple scripts, each serving a unique function. That’s why there are so few codes and why they seem so "simple."

Besides data analysis, my strongest skill is web scraping. In Code01, I included the simplest web scraping script I wrote in R—most of my web scraping work was done in Python.

The other scripts are basic data analysis codes, some with visualizations, maps, or just data processing. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the RAIS code I worked on at CLEAR, which I would have liked to include here.

I really appreciate your consideration!
